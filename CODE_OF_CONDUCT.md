Please refer to [NASA's policies on anti-harassment and diversity](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/odeo/policy-and-publications) for specific definitions and policies. 

## What We Strive For

The S-MODE GitHub organization  is committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all people, with the goal of empowering everyone to collaborate  and contribute to making science more open. 

Any form of behavior to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive collaborative environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviors.

**Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the organization without warning.


**Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:**

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
